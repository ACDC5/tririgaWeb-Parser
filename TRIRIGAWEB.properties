#
# The outgoing SMTP mail server for delivering notifications and messages to
# external mail systems.  This property is for an IP.  The mail
# server must be listening on port 25. 
# Example:
# 10.22.33.29
#
mail.smtp.host=localhost.localdomain

# The outgoing SMTP mail server's domain name for delivering notifications and
# messages. This property is for a domain name, The mail server must
# be listening on port 25. The program will try to use the domain name first,
# and if it is not set, the mail.smtp.host property will be used.
# Example:
# mail.company.com
#
mail.smtp.email.domain=

# IMAPS for IncomingMailAgent
#
# define the path on the network to where the SSL Keystore is to be loaded for the SSL connection.
# If this property is empty, and IMAPS is used for the Incoming Mail Agent, then it is up to the 
# Application Server to set the keystore accordingly. 
mail.imaps.ssl.key=

# This is the default port setting for the IMAPS usage.

# Manage agent settings specific to this TRIRIGA server instance. To manage 
# agent startup host configuration for this server and all other TRIRIGA 
# servers, use the Agent Manager page in the Admin console.
#
# Reference of all TRIRIGA Agent types:
#   WFAgent, DataImportAgent, WFNotificationAgent, SchedulerAgent,
#   ObjectMigrationAgent, ObjectPublishAgent, PlatformMaintenanceScheduler, 
#   FormulaRecalcAgent, ReportQueueAgent, IncomingMailAgent,
#   ExtendedFormulaAgent,  DataConnectAgent, TDIAgent
#

#
# Specify a comma delimited list of agents that are not allowed to run on
# this host. A blank value will allow any of the agents to potentially

#   AGENTS_NOT_ALLOWED=PlatformMaintenanceScheduler,ObjectPublishAgent,ObjectMigrationAgent
#

#
# The INSTANCE properties override the default machine id and machine name.
# If you leave these properties blank then you will rely on the hostname lookup
# to name the instance and calculate the ID. 
# If you want to  easily identify servers in the admin console (not use the hostname), 
# enter an unique ID above 10000 per instance, and a easy to remember unique 
# name per instance, like Dev-App-Server-1,  Dev-Proc-Server-1.
# In the case of two or more TRIRIGA servers running on the same physical 
# machine, unique values here are necessary for independent agent management.
# INSTANCE_ID must be a numeric value under 10000, INSTANCE_NAME can be any
# alphanumeric value.

# Configures when Workflow Instances should be saved.
# Possible values are:
#
#  ERRORS_ONLY         - Only Save when an error occurs (default) and best practice
#  PER_WORKFLOW_ALWAYS - Save the instance if the workflow is configured to save, best for dev
#  ALWAYS              - *** NEVER USE IN A PRODUCTION SYSTEM! ***

#                          Setting Workflow Instance Save to ALWAYS should never be used in a production
#                          system, as it will cause performance issues and excessive space consumption. 
#                          It is better to use PER_WORKFLOW_ALWAYS in a dev environment so you can isolate 
#                          issues without causing instances to be saved for other unrelated application processes.

# This property is used to enable or disable Gantt Strict mode.  By default, Gantt Strict is diabled.
#
# Gantt Strict disabled - all first tasks (tasks without incoming dependencies) are moved left as little as possible.  Planned Task Start Date/End Date 
# are honored and determine where the task instead of the as soon as possible constraint.  The next tasks are moved left only to correct dependencies, 
# the next tasks need not be close to their ancestors

# This can be increased in order to have the Performance Analyzer process larger log files, but this will also result

# This property is to give the customer the ability to decide how to contribute geography and organization security to

# Used by the MissingNotificationsRecoveryTool upgrade class to restore notifications starting from a certain point in time until the present.
# By default, this tool will recover all missing notifications found in the system for all users. This process is run only once with the upgrade class.
#
# To recover missing notifications based on the notification date or age, update only one of these parameters and enter a valid value.
#
# The first parameter NOTIFICATIONS_RECOVERY_FROM_DATE accepts a date format value. The valid format is MM/dd/yyyy (month/day/year).
# For example, to recover notifications from January 15, 2018 until today, enter the value of 01/15/2018.
#
# The second parameter NOTIFICATIONS_RECOVERY_AGE_DAYS accepts a number value. This value represents the number of days from
# which the recovery will start. For example, to recover notifications from 12 days ago until today, enter the value of 12. 
#
# Remove the <BLANK> parameter and update only one these parameters. If both parameters have valid values, then the platform will choose the first parameter
# NOTIFICATIONS_RECOVERY_FROM_DATE. For example, NOTIFICATIONS_RECOVERY_FROM_DATE = 01/15/2018.
#
# If both parameters have blank values, or if an invalid or unexpected value is entered for either parameter, then the platform will treat them as 
# blank values (default) and will recover all missing notifications found in the system for all users.
